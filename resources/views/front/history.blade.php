            <h3>Our Background</h3>
            <p>
APESEK, an organization created in 2002 by Mr. Emanuel Nyandwi, offers vital support to orphans and vulnerable children in the remote region of Rutsiro District and Ngororero District;  Western Province of Rwanda. The aim of the organization is "to raise  childrenâ€™s social well-being to the same level of other children in the region".  Currently we have 25,000 beneficiaries: orphans and vulnerable children, widows, teenage girls who are victims of rape, girls and women who are victims of sexual violence and human trafficking.              </p>
            <p>
        <h3>
            Action:
        </h3>
It provides orphans and vulnerable children with housing, health insurance, access to primary and secondary education, vocational training, socio-economic support, psychological support through an integrated community approach and allows them to make informed choices in reproductive health, HIV testing, treatment and counseling. Most importantly, they organize a community of "mentor mothers'' - women volunteers from the neighborhood / community, who look after and protect the children, ensuring they have access to basic needs.            </p>
